    <h2>Broa (Portuguese Cornbread)</h2>
    <p>This Portuguese cornbread is amazing with soup.</p>
    <p>Deserves to be more popular than it is.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>4 pats unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups cornmeal, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to bubble. Whisk in butter and 2 teaspoons sugar. Add cornmeal and whisk until mixture reaches a thick, sauce-like consistency. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, sprinkle yeast and a pinch of sugar over warm water. Stir and let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixture fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast mixture and mix on low speed. Slowly pour in the milk mixture. Knead into a slightly dense dough. Remove from the bowl and roll into a ball.</li>
            <li>Grease the sides of a bowl or pot with olive oil and add the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down and roll into 2 boules, or flat-bottomed balls. Place boules on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat. Sprinkle tops with flour and cover with plastic wrap again. Let rise until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Fill an oven-proof pot with 4 to 5 cups water and place on the bottom rack of the preheating oven.</li>
            <li>Cut 4 shallow slits into the tops of the puffed bread boules in a cross pattern, 2 parallel lines up and 2 across.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Spritz tops with water from a spray bottle. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue baking until crusts are a deep brown, about 20 minutes. Remove breads from the pan and let cool for 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
