    </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak cod in cold water, skin-side up, for 24 hours, changing water about 4 times. Drain and discard water.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place cod in a saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Transfer cod to a work surface; remove and discard skin and bones. Cut cod into chunks; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes, working in batches if necessary; fry until just cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; drain.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup olive oil to a Dutch oven or heat-proof casserole dish over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cod; cook 3 minutes. Stir in potatoes; cook 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat; vigorously stir in flour. Slowly stream in hot milk while stirring; cook and stir until thick. Season with nutmeg. Stir into cod mixture with 1 1/3 cups cream; stir to coat. Simmer for about 2 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle remaining 2/3 cup cream over mixture; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
