        <h2 class="one">Caldo Verde (Portuguese Green Soup)</h2>
        <p>Caldo verde is one of my favorite Portuguese recipes. This creamy soup made with linguiça sausage and potatoes is greenish in color thanks to a whole pound of fresh kale.</p>
        <p>Enjoy it with a thick slice of your favorite bread.</p>
    <h2 class="two">Ingredients</h2>

    <h2 class="three">Steps</h2>
    </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for 3 minutes. Add potatoes and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Pour in water and bring to a boil; boil gently until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it has released most of its fat, about 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Use an immersion blender to purée potato mixture. Stir in sausage and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in kale and simmer until tender and bright green, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and serve immediately.</li>
